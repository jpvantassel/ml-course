## About this Course

This course includes covers an introduction to the fundamental concepts of
machine learning. The course seeks to provide answers to questions surrounding
an area of research that is often seen as mysterious or unapproachable by the
uninitiated. While this course is very much a work in progress, my hope is that
it will provide a stepping-stone for beginners interested in machine learning
but who are not sure where to begin.

All the best,
